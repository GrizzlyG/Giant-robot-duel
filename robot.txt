                          The Great Robot Duel
                          --------------------
 What happens when global technology giants just happen to possess giant fighting machines at the same time...A duel between them is bound to settle the score.

 So was the case when an American Robot Company..going by the name of MechPrime ...challenged a Japanese Robotic Company,Katanajin to a giant robot duel.
